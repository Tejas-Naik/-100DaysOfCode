There are other types of functions than get() in REQUESTS like:
    requests.post() = this is type of request we give data to the server to execute.
        post doesn't take 'params=' it takes 'json=parameter'
    requests.put()  = this is type of request we give data to the server to put in or edit the post request.
    requests.delete() = this is type of request we delete some data from server


The Post function is little bit different that get 'cause in this we have to give data to the API and it will respond.
The Put function is used to insert some data in the file and delete to delete some data
