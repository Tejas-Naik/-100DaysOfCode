Every HTML element is treated as a box on Screen

think if you have a div of 300px and you give it a  
height of 600px it will push all elements to the top and bottom as applies
to the weight

BOX MODEL
    if you want a border you can specify tht by giving it a border of solid(3px)
        after giving the border solid you still have 300x300 if you want this to have 
        border outside the 300x300 just put border-width:50;
            after applying bodred-width your width is 400x400
            border-width {top bottom left right}

        Padding - space between elements 
            each element should have 20px margin

        Margin - it is the distance between the div and another div 

POSITION
    children sit on top of parents
    POSITION = Static
               Relative
               Absolute
               Fixed
